The requirements for this assignment were as follows:
1. Program to convert the given API log file into a CSV file.
2. Program must be written in either Java or Python
3. Output should be a csv file with only the following columns:  Message, Start Time, End Time, and Time difference between the “start” and the corresponding “end” message
4. Must contain a README with detailed instructions so that we can run the app from a local machine
5. Code must be hosted in github repository where we can access it
6. Can be as simple or as complex as you want, as long as it meets the minimum requirements

I chose to create a very simple Python 3.7 script. I used the following built-in Python libraries:
> re, csv, datetime
